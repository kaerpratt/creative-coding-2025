    <h6 style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; font-style: italic; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">Free Write Exercise</h1>
    
        <h1 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 35px; color: rgb(11, 6, 61);">Lake Michigan</h1>

    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(11, 6, 61);">I’d slept in - that’s what happens on vacation - and taken my time with breakfast, cuddling my cup of tea while chatting with my mom, who sat next to me on the back porch. My siblings were already in the lake and we watched them slipping and sliding on the rocks along the shore, bright swimsuits a stark contrast to the crystal clear droplets sparkling in the August sunlight as they splashed through the waves. Laughter bounced up the shore, calling my name, so when I finished my tea, I changed into my swimsuit and shivered my way to the edge of the water, arriving just as two of my brothers returned from a trip out on the kayaks. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(11, 6, 61);">My sister and third brother took their turn while the rest of us stood waist deep in the chilly water, perched on the rocks that formed a shelf along the edge of the lake, daring each other to step off the edge and over the dark chasm below. But of course we all talked big and only our toes dipped over the edge while our shoulders soaked up the sun. The eleven year old got bored and went to find a wakeboard but my other brother, who would be a senior in college in the fall, stuck around. 
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“What do you think of my girlfriend?”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">I grinned at him; my sister and I had talked about how this was gonna come up. “I think she’s really great! What do you think?”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“Well,” he tossed a rock towards the center of the lake. “I really love her and we’ve talked about getting married.”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">“You don’t say.” I laughed, catching his eye and he rolled his eyes but laughed too, the weight of the real world falling away for a moment. “Just don’t have kids in the first year.”
    </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“Oh? Why not?”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">I shook my head, suddenly serious. “You’ll be fresh out of college, and it’s a bigger adjustment than you’ll expect. And getting married is a huge change too. It’s something that will change both of your lives, but her career and health will be affected far more than yours. Just promise me you’ll take it slow and take care of her.”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">He nodded. “That’s fair. I can do that.”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">We watched our siblings out on the kayaks and listened to the waves caress the rocky shore.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“So…. you interested in anyone?” He grinned.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">I just splashed him, and he returned the favor in full force. When I got the water out of my ears, I shook my head again. “It’s hard to find good options in New York. Plus, I’ve got enough on my plate with grad school, I don’t need another person to take care of when I can’t take care of myself.” </p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“Surrreeeeee…”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">I splashed him again.</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">“How is school going?”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(4, 71, 71);">“It’s… good.” I looked out across the lake, watching the light dance on the water and enjoying the sun on my face. “It’s hard. Really hard sometimes, but it’s good. It’s where I’m supposed to be for now.”</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', sans-serif; color: rgb(152, 113, 14);">He nodded. “I get that.”</p>
